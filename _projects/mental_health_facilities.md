## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between the quality of mental health facilities and the social vulnerability of their surrounding communities. By integrating data from the CDC, CMS, and SAMHSA, I engineered a unified dataset to explore if socioeconomic disparities are linked to healthcare outcomes.

## Key Steps

- Engineered a data processing pipeline in Python (Pandas) to clean and merge disparate datasets from CMS (facility quality), CDC (social vulnerability index), and SAMHSA (prevalence data).
- Created a SQLite database to efficiently store and query the integrated data.
- Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize correlations between social determinants (e.g., poverty, unemployment) and facility metrics (e.g., restraint rates, readmissions).

## Results & Insights

- Identified a positive correlation between a county's social vulnerability score and the use of restraints in its mental health facilities.
- The analysis suggests that improving mental healthcare outcomes requires addressing underlying community-level social factors, not just facility-level policies.
