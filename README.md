Data Analysis Projects

### Overview
This repository serves as a portfolio of my data analysis projects. Each project demonstrates my skills in turning raw data into actionable insights through analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization.

My process typically involves:
*   **Acquiring** data from various sources (APIs, public datasets, web scraping, satellite imagery).
*   **Cleaning and Preprocessing** data using Python (Pandas, NumPy) to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies (ETL).
*   **Storing** and managing data in SQL databases for efficient querying and analysis.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and correlations.
*   **Applying Statistical Models and Machine Learning** (e.g., Regression, Classification, Time-Series Analysis) to build predictive models and test hypotheses.
*   **Visualizing Results** using tools like Tableau, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create compelling dashboards and charts that tell a clear story.
*   **Translating Technical Findings** into concrete business or policy recommendations.

### Technical Skills
*   **Programming & Databases:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy), SQL, R, Java
*   **Data Visualization & BI:** Tableau, Excel (PivotTables, Charts), Matplotlib, Seaborn
*   **Tools & Platforms:** Git, Jupyter Notebook, SQLite, Google Colab
*   **Concepts & Methods:** Data Wrangling & ETL, Statistical Analysis, Regression Modeling, Random Forest Classification, Time-Series Analysis, Geospatial Analysis

### Project Highlights

| Project Name | Key Skills Demonstrated | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Mental Health Facilities Analysis](link-to-project-1)** | `Python` `Pandas` `SQL` `Tableau` `ETL` | Integrated and analyzed CDC SVI and facility data to visualize correlations between social determinants and mental health outcomes across the U.S. |
| **[Flood Detection Mapping](link-to-project-2)** | `Python` `NumPy` `Scikit-learn` `Geospatial Data` `Machine Learning` | Processed satellite imagery to engineer a Random Forest classification model for flood prediction, achieving 92% accuracy. |
| **[Housing Market Analysis](link-to-project-3)** | `Python` `Pandas` `Time-Series Analysis` `Linear Regression` `Data Visualization` | Modeled 50 years of FHFA housing data to predict national trends with 99.97% accuracy and generate policy recommendations. |

### How to Navigate This Portfolio
Each project is contained in its own directory. Within a project folder, you will typically find:
*   A `README.md` with a detailed overview of the project's goals, methodology, and results.
*   The source code (Jupyter Notebooks `.ipynb` or Python scripts `.py`).
*   A link to the interactive Tableau dashboard or other visualizations (if applicable).
*   Any necessary resources or references.
